# In this assignment we playd with colors. 

Why do color matter on the web ? 

Worldwide, there are approximately 300 million people with colour blindness, almost the same number of people as the entire population of the USA! There are different causes of colour blindness.

People with deuteranomaly and protanomaly are collectively known as red-green colour blind and they generally have difficulty distinguishing between reds, greens, browns and oranges. They also commonly confuse different types of blue and purple hues. 

so you can probably imagen thet some color combinations will not work for them if the contrast is not 
good enough.Â If the background and the text dose not have a big enough contrast, they cant read the text. 

I often use https://contrastchecker.com/ to check my color.
But you can also inspect element on the website and click on the element you want to se the contrast for.
